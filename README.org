This repository contains the notes I took during I was reading the
book /[[https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html][Sturcture and Interpretation of Computer Programs]]/.

** Preset
To execute code blocks in this project inside Org Mode, you need
to have Racket on your device. Put [[https://github.com/DEADB17/ob-racket][ob-racket]] inside your Emacs
load path and run the following block before any other blocks.
This will make sure you have all dependencies installed.  

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
(use-package racket-mode)
(use-package ob-racket
  :load-path "~/.emacs.d/packages"
  :after org
  :pin manual
  :config
  (append '((racket . t) (scribble . t)) org-babel-load-languages))
#+END_SRC
